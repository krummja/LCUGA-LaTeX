  abstract = {This paper is a study in lexical categories; specifically, in nominality. Nouns are argued to refer primarily to kind-level sorts, which define categories of entities in the speakers' conceptualization. This notion is characterized in semantic, ontological, and cognitive terms. Sorts, or nominal concepts, represent what is specifically nominal in lexical semantics. Not all nominalized properties are concepts; in particular, not transparent deverbal nominalizations. Concepts thus provide a substantive notion of nominality not coextensive with the morphosyntactic one. I present some evidence for the linguistic reality of this notion. In word formation and in phrases like plastic flower, the semantic value of a noun is its concept and not what it may be true of. The two often differ, as concepts are typically based on function and conventional expectations more than on objective properties. Concepts also seem to be needed in expressing semantic restrictions on affixation (ornamental, but *employmental). Finally, concepts are the value of nouns, not of any of their pieces; in particular, not of roots. This emerges clearly from the examination of different nouns (and verbs) sharing one root, and accords with the view that lexical categories have content, and roots are category-free.},

This is based on a constructionist approach which views nouns as substructures of the noun phrase, and word formation and inflection as the morphological spellout of structures assembled and interpreted at an abstract syntactic level. It argues that nouns fundamentally identify entity types, and the rest of the DP specifies their denotation in part-structural and quantificational terms. This provides the framework for a new unified analysis of nouns like furniture, waters , and contents , where number and countability interact in a non-canonical way, which accounts for their morphology and their semantics.},

These questions remain as important now as they were some 15 years ago, when Michal Starke introduced the basics of the NS theory. Despite the fact that several written sources on NS have been available since 2007, there is still a lot of confusion about what NS actually is, and how NS and DM compare to each other. The present paper is an attempt to clear things up.},

Instead, it presents a single idea about representation which allows advances made by several different groups to be combined into an imaginary system called GLOM1. The advances include transformers, neural fields, contrastive representation learning, distillation and capsules. GLOM answers the question: How can a neural network with a fixed architecture parse an image into a partwhole hierarchy which has a different structure for each image? The idea is simply to use islands of identical vectors to represent the nodes in the parse tree. If GLOM can be made to work, it should significantly improve the interpretability of the representations produced by transformer-like systems when applied to vision or language.},

By unarticulated constituent is meant a propositional (or conceptual) constituent of a sentence that is communicated by the speaker in uttering that sentence, but is not linguistically represented in that uttered sentence. The main aim of this article is to provide a neo-Gricean pragmatic analysis of unarticulated constituents, showing that the current existing mechanism of neo-Gricean pragmatic theory can handle unarticulated constituents in a straightforward and elegant way. Second, I defend the neo-Gricean position that the pragmatic enrichment of unarticulated constituents is nothing but a neo-Gricean, pre-semantic conversational implicature. And third and finally, I briefly evaluate an alternative, formal syntactico-semantic analysis of unarticulated constituents.},

Depending on one's definition of what constitutes agreement, it is either found in virtually every natural language that we know of, or it is at least found in a great many. Either way, it seems to be a core part of the system that underpins our syntactic knowledge. Since the introduction of the operation of Agree in Chomsky (2000), agreement phenomena and the mechanism that underlies agreement have garnered a lot of attention in the Minimalist literature and have received different theoretical treatments at different stages. Since then, many different phenomena involving dependencies between elements in syntax, including movement or not, have been accounted for using Agree. The mechanism of Agree thus provides a powerful tool to model dependencies between syntactic elements far beyond {$\varphi$}-feature agreement. The articles collected in this volume further explore these topics and contribute to the ongoing debates surrounding agreement. The authors gathered in this book are internationally reknowned experts in the field of Agreement.},
